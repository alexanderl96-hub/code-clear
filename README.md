# Project Code Clear: An app dedicated to progressing people to become better coders.


# Running the application

Link to the application : "here"

  * Go to the website
  * Import/paste the code that needs to be analyzed
  * Press the Submit button


# Description

Code Clear is an unique app that supports the user's growth as a coder by giving a detailed report of their bad coding habits. When code is imported and submitted, the code will be analyzed for code quailty and errors. The user will be displayed a list of errors, so that the user can correct them. Through continuous submissions of code, the app will be able to track the user's progress over time though an annual code quality chart, an linter error/warning breakdown chart, and an linter error/warning frequency chart. By doing this, the user is able to determine which types of errors occur frequently and focus on fixing those errors.

# Features

   * A screen splash to engage the user while the home page loads
   * A light/dark mode to accommodate the eyes of the user
   * A severity level indicator for each linter issue
   * A scroll down feature for the results section to create a more user friendly display.
   * A feature which lets you click on a Linting Error in the Results component to highlight the  exact location of the problem in the Code Editor
   * A star rating system to help users determine the holistic quality of the user's code, as well as providing them with a score that evaluates their code level
   * A fix button that will display a second Editor with a corrected version of the user's code
   * Report graphs to display the frequency of the type of severity level the user gets
   * Firebase account display that is able to create, login, recover, update, delete accounts

# Our mission

This project was created by our team's burning desire to become better coders. Many members of our team struggled with sloppy code, which hinder our understanding and growth in a collaborative setting. Code Clear is designed to help users identify the types of coding mistakes that they make and fix them. We want the user to also keep not just fix their code but to fix their bad coding habit. By keeping track of their progress, the user can prevent repeating specific types of coding mistakes. By writing more consistant code, programmers become more desireable especially when looking for jobs in tech.

# Challenges

Most of the challenges come from reading and understanding documentations for developing and customizing our Integrated Development Environment, setting up firebase and Eslint. Other challenges include getting the report charts to use data coming from the backend as opposed to mock data in the front end.

# Future improvements

We want our application to support other languages besides javascript.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

 In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
